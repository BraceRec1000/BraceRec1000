### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**BraceRec1000/BraceRec1000** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

The code file is the .mlx. The .png files needed for the brace reccomendation output are included in the file MATLABMASTERS_DATA.zip. The MATLABMASTERS_SampleOutput.zip contains 3 screenshots of outputs from the code which displays the brace reccomendation graphic. 

Run the code as a live script in matlab and follow the prompts on the right hand side. For the first step, there is an option to either continue or view the citations. For the next step, the user is asked to select their activity level from 2 selections. The next step asks the user their severity of Osteoarthritis (from 3 selections), and the last step asks the user their preference for custom or off-the-shelf braces. When the questions are answered a graphic with the reccomeded brace is displayed.
